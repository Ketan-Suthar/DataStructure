/*
Given a singly linked list. The task is to find the length of the linked list, where length is defined as the number of nodes in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
Output: 5
Explanation: Count of nodes in the 
linked list is 5, which is its length.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 2->4->6->7->5->1->0
Output: 7
Explanation: Count of nodes in the
linked list is 7. Hence, the output
is 7.
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the given function getCount(), which takes a head reference as an argument and should return the length of the linked list.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= value <= 103
*/
lass Solution
{
    //Function to count nodes of a linked list.
    public static int getCount(Node head)
    {   int count=0;
        Node temp =head;
        
        while(temp!=null){
            temp=temp.next;
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    
    }
}
